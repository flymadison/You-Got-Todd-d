## The Story

As a streamer that plays Skyrim: Special Edition quite often for my viewers, and mods the living heck out of the game, I get **Todd'd** often. Really, often enough to where I wanted to keep track of it on my Twitch stream.

So...

I built this little mess of an application to keep track for me. Why?

 ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## How To Use

### Setup
Start the application, then set up a **Text (GDI)** source in OBS that reads from the **todd.txt** file. Then, Skyrim does the rest!

### Commands

| Key | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Control + C | Exit the application |
| Control + M | Manually increase the Todd counter by 1 |
| Control + N | Manually decrease the Todd counter by 1 |
